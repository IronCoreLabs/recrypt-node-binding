## 0.5.2

+ Depend on official release of Neon 0.3.

## 0.5.1

### Breaking Changes

+ Added support for Node 12
+ Removed support for Node 9 and 11
+ Removed the `hash256` method from the API. Use the `deriveSymmetricKey` method instead.

### Changed

+ Updated all dependencies to their latest versions, including Recrypt to 0.8.

## 0.4.2

### Added

None

### Breaking Changes

None

### Changed

+ Added support to build artifacts for Node 9 and Node 11.

## 0.4.1

### Added
+ `Api256.hash256(hashable_buffer: Buffer): Buffer;` Note that the returned `Buffer` will always be _exactly_ 32 bytes.

## 0.4.0

### Breaking Changes

+ Renamed the `transformKeyToBytes` method to `transformKeyToBytes256` to specify that it only works with 256 bit TransformKeys.
+ Removed incorrect empty array from TransformKey objects.

### Added

None

### Changed

+ Added `engines`, `os`, and `cpu` keys to `package.json` to specify which Node version and architectures this library will work on.

## 0.3.0

### Breaking Changes

+ The `Api256.encrypt`, `Api256.generateTransformKey`, `Api256.transform` functions now only take a private signing key and no longer need to provide a public signing key.

### Added

+ Added new `transformKeyToBytes` top level method to convert a `TransformKey` object into a Buffer in a consistent order. Useful for being able to sign over the bytes of a `TransformKey`.

### Changed

+ Updated to `recrypt-rs` 0.3.0.

## 0.2.0

### Breaking Changes

None

### Added

* Added methods for [Schnorr signing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schnorr_signature).
    + `Api256::schnorrSign(privateKey: Buffer, publicKey: PublicKey, message: Buffer): Signature;`
    + `Api256::schnorrVerify(publicKey: PublicKey, augmentedPrivateKey: Buffer | undefined, message: Buffer, signature: Signature): boolean;`
* Exposed methods to perform ed25519 signing and verification as well as method to compute an ed25519 public key given it's matching private key.
    + `Api256::ed25519Sign(privateKey: PrivateSigningKey, message: Buffer): Signature;`
    + `Api256::ed25519Verify(publicKey: PublicSigningKey, message: Buffer, signature: Signature): boolean;`
    + `Api256::computeEd25519PublicKey(privateKey: PrivateSigningKey): PublicSigningKey;`

### Changed

* Consumed changes from [`recrypt-rs`](https://github.com/IronCoreLabs/recrypt-rs)([#1](https://github.com/IronCoreLabs/recrypt-rs/issues/1)) to zero secret bytes after use
* Moved `benchmark` and `test` repos to the root of the repo
