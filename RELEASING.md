# Release Checklist

-   PR and merge the `CHANGELOG.md` entry for the release by looking at the commits.
-   Decide on the new version number and run the [Bump Version](https://github.com/IronCoreLabs/recrypt-node-binding/actions/workflows/bump-version.yaml) action. This will create a GitHub release and trigger the Typescript Release action.
